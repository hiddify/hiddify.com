</div>

There are two options. You can choose the `Normal` config marked in orange or use the `Lite` config the green one. `Lite` config do not pass the traffic of domestic sites through the VPN, so when your VPN is active, you do not need to turn it off to go to domestic sites. On the other hand, the `Normal` configuration passes all the traffic through the VPN and. If the option to block domestic sites is enabled in the panel settings, these sites will not be opened, but if [WARP](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/How-to-activate-WARP-on-the-Hiddify-panel) is enabled, domestic sites will be opened using WARP.

## Fix sound problem in some programs
Sometimes it may have happened to you that the sound does not play in some programs like Club House. To fix this problem, you can enter `TCP` from `Settings` and then change your `Fingerprint`.

## Activate the app shortcut

## Activate Killer Switch
For this, enter the `On Demand` section in `Settings`.


<div align=center>

<img width=30% src="https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/assets/125398461/af641742-dc91-468e-9135-78de911e6703" />
</div>



#### Always On
By turning this option on, your VPN will always be on.

#### On Demand
By turning on this option, when your internet is interrupted, ShadoRoket will disconnect your entire internet to prevent your original IP from being revealed.

#### Disconnect on Sleep
If you enable this option, the VPN will be disconnected after the phone goes to sleep mode.

## Share connection with other devices
Suppose you have a device that cannot install a VPN and needs to be connected to the free Internet. For this, you can use the connection sharing option in ShadRocket. Enter the `Proxy` section in the `Settings` menu and select `Proxy Share`. If you enable the Enable Share option, your VPN will be shared on the specified IP and port.

<div align=center>

<img width=30% src="https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/assets/125398461/d764b726-6ddd-4a5a-aa76-f9ad8165e4f1" />
</div>




To use on another device that is in the same network as your phone, you can enter its proxy settings and enter the IP and port. This device will connect to the free internet without installing any VPN.

## Create load balance
Holding your finger on the home screen and sliding down opens the app's hidden menu.

<div align=center>

<img width=30% src="https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/assets/125398461/59872f56-e9ff-4c50-85a0-65ccd488e704" />
</div>



Press the `+` button to create a load balance.

<div align=center>

</div>






Give a desired name and set the `Type` to `load-balance`. Then, from the `Policy` section, select the configurations that have better ping or even all configurations. In the `Interval` section, you can specify the time between load balance connection tests. In the `Timeout` section, you can also specify the length of time a connection remains disconnected and is still considered valid. But if it's the first time you set this part, you can set the timer settings to default for now. Finally, save.

<div align=center>

</div>


Now click on the created load balancer and tap `Test`. With this, the load balance test is performed and its connection is established. By turning ShadowRocket on or off, load balance is also turned on or off.
