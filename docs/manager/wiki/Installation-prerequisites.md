# Installation prerequisites

Before installation, you need a series of prerequisites:

- First, you need a virtual server. You can prepare the server in several ways.

  - You can get your virtual server directly from famous data centers in the world using credit card or other payment methods. You can search on Google and find [inexpensive servers](https://www.google.com/search?q=buy+cheap+and+good+quality+vps+server). You can also visit [this list](https://github.com/hiddify/awesome-freedom/blob/main/vps-providers.md) in which we have collected servers with various specifications.

  - You can also provide your own server using crypto currency. For this, just search on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=purchase+vps+using+crypto). There are many providers that support cryptocurrency. See our [list](https://github.com/hiddify/awesome-freedom/blob/main/vps-providers.md). Some of these data centers support cryptocurrencies that are specified in the list.
        
- Minimum resource requirements:
  - 1 GB Ram
  - 1 Core CPU
  - 10 GB Storage
- The operating system of this virtual server must be Ubuntu 22.04. Ubuntu is a distribution of Linux operating system whose logo is like this. ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu--E95420?style=flat-square&logo=ubuntu)

- Then if you need to connect to your server via SSH please visit [this link](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/How-to-connect-to-server-via-SSH) for more information.
