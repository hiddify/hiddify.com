That is, in this case, messengers are used as intermediate servers (relay) and traffic is sent to the main server through them. This can be used for messengers that are active inside Iran and support this protocol, or for foreign messengers that are not filtered. The diagram of free internet connection in this case is as follows.</p> <p>Note that this feature only works for configurations that are on the UDP protocol. This means that this feature can be used on Hysteria2 or TUIC v5, but it cannot be used for reality.</p> <p>To use it, just put the parameters of that messenger at the end of your config link according to the command below.</p> <pre><code>relay=urlencoded(turn://user:pass@host:port?realm=t)\n</code></pre> <p>Where <code>user</code> is the username to connect to the protocol in the desired messenger. <code>pass</code> is also the password for this account in that messenger. Also, <code>host</code> is the host-name for connecting to the messenger, and <code>port</code> is the port for connecting to the messenger. The <code>realm</code> parameter is related to the authentication area inside the host-name. That is, which area of the messenger can be authenticated with this account.</p> <p>For example, in Bale messenger (an Iranian Messenger), these parameters are as follows.</p> <pre><code>relay=urlencoded(turn://balelivekit:GygZPHQSgAV7L5L8@meet-turn.bale.sh:443?realm=bale.ai)\n</code></pre> <p>First, you convert this information to UTF-8 using an Encoder. For example, you can use this Encoder, the output of which is as follows:</p> <pre><code>relay=turn%3A%2F%2Fbalelivekit%3AGygZPHQSgAV7L5L8%40meet-turn.bale.sh%3A443%3Frealm%3Dbale.ai\n</code></pre> <p>Now if we have a hysteria configuration based on UDP as follows:</p> <pre><code>hysteria2://87543215-15ac-54f6-3895-34e4e931f5b4@45.120.34.46:11464?hiddify=1&amp;obfs=salamander&amp;obfs-password=bdgf!huy678559j89GrTu&amp;sni=www.speedtest.net&amp;insecure=1#test\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, we add the encoded information related to the relay (messenger) at the end of the hysteria link. For this, we first put an <code>&amp;</code> and copy the link exactly before <code>#</code> as below:</p> <pre><code>hysteria2://87543215-15ac-54f6-3895-34e4e931f5b4@45.120.34.46:11464?hiddify=1&amp;obfs=salamander&amp;obfs-password=bdgf!huy678559j89GrTu&amp;sni=www.speedtest.net&amp;insecure=1&amp;relay=turn%3A%2F%2Fbalelivekit%3AGygZPHQSgAV7L5L8%40meet-turn.bale.sh%3A443%3Frealm%3Dbale.ai#test\n</code></pre> <p>You can import this link in the Hiddify-Next program and because this program supports the UDP Turn Relay protocol, you can use this feature.</p> <p>NOTE!</p> <p>Bale messenger disabled the said feature after a short time. Based on the contents explained above, you should find a messenger that supports this feature from the list of internal messengers of Iran or non-filtered external messengers.</p>"},{"location":"app/How-to-use-WARP-on-Hiddify-App/","title":"How to Use WARP on HiddifyApp","text":"<p>WARP is a service based on WireGuard provided by Cloudflare.

That was the beginning of this project, and Hiddify was born during these very days.</p> <p>In the first days, we tried to review various censorship methods and create a list of VPS providers.</p> <p>After that, we created extremely easy and free installations for Microsoft Azure.</p> <p>We expanded the project to other datacenters, including quick installations for Hetzner, Oracle Cloud, and OVH. The goal was for everyone to be able to set up their own server without any technical knowledge.</p> <p>Then, we developed the initial version of the Hiddify server and tried to teach the activation process for the client in a simple way. We also worked to ensure that the server app was resistant to VPN detection bots, obtained valid certificates, set safety configurations, and applied appropriate settings.</p> <p>As time passed and the internet situation remained dire, we worked harder to simplify complex concepts to make them accessible to everyone. Additionally, we made many articles and tutorial videos available so that everyone could perform complex configurations.</p> <p>On the client side, existing apps were not as user-friendly as they should have been. Our parents, for example, couldn\u2019t connect with them at all.</p> <p>To address this, we first created custom versions of Hiddify Clash for Android and desktop to make the user connection process easier.</p> <p>Gradually, your support for the project grew, and this provided extra motivation to add more features to the panel. We developed the multi-user version of the panel, redesigned many components, improved structures, and set up a support group on Telegram.</p> <p>On the client side, after developing several versions of the Hiddify Clash app, many bugs in the Clash Meta core led us to seek an alternative solution.</p> <p>After thoroughly reviewing and redesigning the entire client process based on performance tests, we decided to use the best market solutions. This led to the birth of the custom HiddifyNG and HiddifyN versions, which were warmly welcomed by you all.</p> <p>For example, HiddifyNG was downloaded more than 100,000 times on Google Play and received a 4.8 out of 5 rating from you, which is incredible for an app less than five months old.</p> <p>At the same time, on the server side, we added new protocols and introduced more features, including automatic CDN IP selection, simultaneous use of multiple domains, adding intermediate nodes, and many other features that cannot all be mentioned here.</p>","tags":["Hiddify","Free Internet Solution"]},{"location":"blog/2023/09/23/one-year-anniversary-of-hiddify/#one-year-anniversary-of-hiddify_1","title":"One-Year Anniversary of Hiddify","text":"<p>On our first anniversary:</p> <p>On the client side, we introduced the cross-platform HiddifyNext app for Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac, and we will soon release it for iOS as well.</p> <p>Our goal was to make it easy for developers to implement new protocols across all operating systems and to maintain integration across platforms.</p> <p>The new app design is simple, performs efficiently, and uses minimal system resources. We will continue to add more exciting new features to it.</p> <p>If you are a panel developer, you can read here how to integrate your panel with the app.</p> <p>On the server side, in addition to previous protocols like Vless, Vmess, and Trojan, we introduced newer protocols such as Reality gRPC, WebSocket, H2, and SSH.

They will be officially released soon.</p> <p>If you would like to test the beta version and use the newer protocols, you can find out how to upgrade to the beta here.

In this method, several requests and responses are exchanged between the server and the client to start and end the information exchange operation. Imagine that the client (browser) is a person who intends to receive information about a site. At first, he must send a request to the server of that site. Then he has to wait to receive a response from the server to his request. If the requested information is available on the server, a response will be sent to the person agreeing to send the information. Then again, a message is sent from the client requesting information data to the server. At this stage, the server receives the message and divides the requested data into smaller data packets.

Here are the steps to do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open the SSH Daemon Configuration File:    Open the SSH daemon configuration file (<code>sshd_config</code>) in a text editor. You will typically need elevated privileges to edit this file. You can use a command-line text editor like <code>nano</code> or <code>vim</code>. For example:    <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Locate the 'Port' Directive:    Look for the line that starts with <code>Port</code>. This line specifies the port on which the SSH server listens. The default is usually <code>22</code>. You can change it to any unused port, for example:    <pre><code>Port 2222\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Save and Exit:    Save the changes and exit the text editor. For <code>nano</code>, you can typically do this by pressing <code>Ctrl + X</code>, then <code>Y</code> to confirm the changes, and finally <code>Enter</code> to exit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Restart the SSH Service:    After modifying the configuration file, you need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect. Use the following command:    <pre><code>sudo service ssh restart\n</code></pre></p> </li> </ol> <p>Alternatively, you can use the following command on more recent Ubuntu versions:    <pre><code>sudo systemctl restart ssh\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li> <p>Verify the Changes:    You can verify that SSH is now listening on the new port by running:    <pre><code>netstat -tuln | grep &lt;new_port&gt;\n</code></pre>    Replace <code>&lt;new_port&gt;</code> with the port number you specified in the configuration file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Update Firewall Rules using <code>iptables</code> in Linux:    If you are using <code>iptables</code> as firewall manager, make sure to update the rules to allow traffic on the new SSH port. </p> </li> </ol> <p><pre><code>sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT\n</code></pre>    Replace <code>2222</code> with your new SSH port.</p> <p>After adding a rule, you may need to save the changes to make them persistent across reboots. The method for saving rules can vary depending on your Linux distribution.</p> <p>For Ubuntu, you can use the iptables-save and iptables-restore commands:    <pre><code>sudo sh -c 'iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4'\n</code></pre>    This command saves the current iptables rules to a file, and you can restore them with:</p> <pre><code>sudo sh -c 'iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4'\n</code></pre> <p>Remember that changing the SSH port can enhance security by making it less predictable, but it's also essential to update your firewall rules and remember the new port when connecting.</p>"},{"location":"manager/basic-concepts-and-troubleshooting/How-to-check-and-prevent-DNS-leaks/","title":"How to check and prevent DNS leaks","text":"<p>One of the most important issues in the Internet world is security and privacy.

For example, if a new clean IP is placed in the CDN connection, the information about this new IP is transferred to your client through the subscription link. On the other hand, clients go to the free Internet through different connections that are separate from the subscription link.

In the content distribution network, the data placed on the website or applications is cached or stored in the <code>CDN</code> servers and allows users around the world to exchange information with that website or application at a faster rate. It also reduces ping and jitter by its very nature, but how is this possible? Suppose you need to visit a website in Iran or exchange information through a special program with America. If your destination platform does not use a <code>CDN</code>, to exchange information, the sent packet must travel the entire network path to the destination to deliver the request, and this process must be done again to return the packets. Naturally, in this scenario, due to the long distance between the user and the main server, it will not be possible to send and receive at high speed, and the delay in loading and loading pages is clearly visible. However, if the content distribution network is used in the above scenario, all the data of that platform is stored in the Origin servers or the edge server and the user is connected to the nearest edge server based on their geographical area and with faster speed and less delay than exchanging information with The destination takes action. In the picture below, you can see the overview of this scenario.</p> <p></p> <p>Now the question may be raised to you, what is the need to use this content distribution network in setting up the filter breaker with this account? Above we mentioned one of the benefits of using this technology, but the story does not end here. The important and vital thing that is used to set up filtering servers on this platform is that your server's IP is not identified from the point of view of regulatory bodies and filtering systems. As mentioned above, during the exchange of information with the destination server, the user is connected to the Origin Servers instead of direct communication, and these edge servers are responsible for exchanging information with the main server. With this account, the IP of your server remains hidden from the eyes of government monitoring institutions, and its filtering becomes remarkably impossible! Let's see the test and the result practically. Here we create an A record in Cloudflare and turn off the proxy (the ability to use CDN) for it so that the created subdomain does not use the <code>CDN</code> ability and is directly connected to the main server.</p> <p></p> <p>Then ping the created subdomain:</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see in the image above, the main IP of the server can be identified and filtered easily. In the next test, we enable the proxy option for the created subdomain and compare the results:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In this case, the test output is no longer the IP of the main server, but the IP of the edge servers that are closest to you and connected to. Also, in order to better understand how to reduce ping and jitter and increase speed when using CDN, we checked the route taken by packets by <code>Tracing Route</code>. The images below show that when using a CDN, the access path to the server is much shorter, so that in this example, the packets pass through more than 10 routers in direct mode, and this problem causes more delay and decreases its speed and performance.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"manager/domain-worker-cdn-and-tunneling/What-is-CDN-and-how-does-it-help-us%3F/#the-reason-why-cloudflare-is-not-completely-filtered","title":"The reason why Cloudflare is not completely filtered","text":"<p>Now, you may be wondering why government institutions have not completely filtered Cloudflare and other disruptions have been applied to the IPs under its control?
